# Unity-KeepSceneFocus
  
Ever get annoyed that you have to click Scene view every time you press play?  
Me too.  
  
### GENERAL INFO
This script sends you back to the Scene view window whenever you press the play button, therefore preventing unity from forcing you on the Game window instead.  
It also has a feature that lets the VRC SDK bypass the script whenever the "Build & Publish for Windows" button is pressed (default ON).  
  
-------------------------------------------
### INSTALLATION:
1) Download the "KeepSceneFocus.cs" file.  
2) Put it anywhere in your Assets folder.  
3) Open KSF from the Menu bar at the top left of Unity (next to "File" "Edit" etc).  
4) Press the big "Create GameObject" button.  
5) Enjoy :)  
  
  
### HOW TO USE:
Once you follow the steps above, you're all set.  
The VRC SDK Bypass is ON by default Because after pressing "Build & Publish for Windows", the 'Upload Avatar' button is located in the game window.  
  
For quick access to the settings or if you don't like to use a window, the script settings are also located in the GameObject named "Keep Scene Focus" in your hierarchy after it's been created.  
Please avoid renaming the GameObject as it confuses the KSF window.

-------------------------------------------
  
This is the fist script I've made for Unity 2019.4.31f1, so don't judge me.  
I have a few feature ideas I might add later on (like making the hierarchy GameObject optional (mostly because of worlds)), but life gets busy busy so no promises.
